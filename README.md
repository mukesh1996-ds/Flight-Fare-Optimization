# Supply Chain Optimization Project

## Overview
This project focuses on optimizing supply chain processes using the PuLP library in Python. The objective is to minimize production and shipping costs while meeting customer demand effectively.

## Datasets Used
The following datasets are used in this project:

- **Fixed Production Costs**: Monthly fixed costs incurred by production facilities (in $/Month).
- **Variable Production Costs**: Costs that vary depending on the number of units produced (in $/Unit).
- **Shipping Costs**: Total costs associated with transporting goods to customers (in $).
- **Customer Demand**: Expected units that customers will purchase (in Units).

## PuLP Library Usage
The project leverages the PuLP library for optimization:

- **LpProblem**: Defines the optimization problem.
- **LpMinimize**: Indicates that the goal is to minimize costs.
- **lpSum**: Creates linear expressions to sum production and shipping costs.

## Importance of Supply Chain Optimization
Supply chain optimization is crucial for several reasons:

- **Cost Reduction**: Minimizes production and shipping costs, enhancing profitability.
- **Efficiency Improvement**: Streamlines operations for faster production cycles and better responsiveness to customer demand.
- **Resource Allocation**: Ensures effective allocation of resources to meet demand without excess inventory.
- **Customer Satisfaction**: Improves order fulfillment, increasing customer satisfaction and loyalty.
- **Risk Mitigation**: Enhances resilience against supply or demand fluctuations.

## Installation
To install the required dependencies, create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:

```
PuLP==2.5
```

Then, install the dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
